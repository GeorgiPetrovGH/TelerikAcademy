1.Oracle Netbeans
Netbeans is an open-source environment, for developing primary with Java,
but also supports other languages like C/C++, Ruby, HTML5, PHP and more.
Netbeans is extremely extensible via its plugin-centric design, allowing 
you to add additional language syntax support and libraries, among other things.

2.Eclipse
Eclipse is quite comprehensive and even similar to Netbeans in a variety of ways,
including its use of Java and plugin architecture. However, Eclipse as an IDE comes
in a wild variety of flavors, catering to various needs and objectives in software 
development workflows.

3.Code::Blocks
Code::Blocks is free, open source cross-platform, which is exceptionally lightweight
in size, yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE. You can load up a number of
under-the-hood compiler engines, ranging from GCC and LLVM, to Digital Mars and Open Watcom.
Code::Blocks also takes advantage of multi-core compiling, allowing you to get the job done faster.

4.Aptana Studio 3
Aptana offers one of the most powerful open-source IDEs. Based on Eclipse, it supports
JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Python and more. It’s been completely re-built
to provide a faster and seamless environment for developing and testing an entire
web application using a single environment.

5.Cloud 9 IDE
Cloud 9 allows you to collaborate publicly or privately in workspaces. Write, run
and debug code from the cloud, working with team members remotely and in real-time,
with group editing and chatting capabilities for seamless communication
and more effective collaboration.
